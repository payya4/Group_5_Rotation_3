# Introduction
We have been assigned two proteins from a selection scan that showed positive selection in tetraploid Cochleria officinalis compared to the diploid Cochlearia pyrenica. The task we have is to analyse the differences in these two key proteins between two species of cochleria (diploid and tetraploid) to uncover any differences within them that may lead to this positive selection. In summary, we start with some sequence data and hope to end up with structural data that we can interpret visually, and through scientific studies, to compare and contrast the proteins in both diploid and tetraploid states.
